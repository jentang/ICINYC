# ICT4G Research

## Design firm
[Mod Lab](https://mod-lab.com/) - Design firm we'd like to work with 

## Platforms/software/apps
[Countable](https://www.countable.us/) - website and app of bills coming to a vote, includes local section, allows for user vote and commenting, also can contact elected officials through the app.  

[allourideas.org](http://allourideas.org/) - super simple "wiki" survey building and polling platform.  

[VotoMobile](https://www.votomobile.org/) - developed in Ghana and can use voice and SMS (allowing use of local languages), collects and can analyze data. Their API (computer code that sets the architecture of the program) is available so we can adapt it to our needs. I think it’s “open” even, so we can invite coders who are interested (there is a large community of civic coders) in our project to help us write the code for our needs.  

[Tracfm.org](http://tracfm.org/) - developed in Uganda to facilitate both polling, and then discussions on the radio.  

[Govright.org](http://govright.org/) - a platform that Tarik Nesh-Nash is part of launching, a generic platform built by Quanan lab to move towards a more open form of governance where citizens co-author laws.  

##Allies & Resources
**[Youth Participatory Politics Research Network](http://ypp.dmlcentral.net/)** runs [action](http://ypp.dmlcentral.net/action-projects) and [reserach](http://ypp.dmlcentral.net/research-projects) projects. They also collect some very useful [publications](http://ypp.dmlcentral.net/publications).   
Of _particular relevance_ to our tech design work right now is the [Digital Platforms Project](http://ypp.dmlcentral.net/projects/digital-platforms-project), a distillation of design principles aimed at platform designers.  
[The Youth Participatory Politics Survey Project](http://ypp.dmlcentral.net/projects/youth-participatory-politics-survey-project) is a nationally representative survey of how young people 15-25 experience and participate in public life.  
[The Good Participation Project](http://ypp.dmlcentral.net/projects/good-participation-project) is a study of young people’s civic and political participation in a digital age, and the interplay of conditions that promote "good participation."  
[The Activists and Participatory Politics project](http://ypp.dmlcentral.net/projects/activists-and-participatory-politics) seeks to provide support and highlight the effective practices of activist groups that promote participatory politics and youth civic and political engagement.  
[The Media, Activism, and Participatory Politics (MAPP) Project](http://ypp.dmlcentral.net/projects/media-activism-and-participatory-politics) - five case studies of youth-driven communities that scaffolded skills and networks of participatory culture into civic engagement and political participation for social change.

[School of Data](https://schoolofdata.nyc/open-call-for-school-of-data-session-proposals/) - now an annual civic tech and open data conference for the NYC community. It used to be a hackathon to celebrate Open Data Day, but has now morphed to encompass more.  

[Poplus](http://poplus.org) - a federated tech community of civic coders that helped to build the votaintelligente.cl and nousabook.ma (now offline) tools.  

[CUNY ServiceCorps](http://www1.cuny.edu/sites/servicecorps/community-partners/current/) - CUNY undergrads asigned to work with community organizations including City agencies. We could potentially apply to be a partner organization and have a student work with us.

###Training in NYC
[GovLab](http://govlab.org) - an academic, training, advocacy organization run out of NYU that has been less active since 2016.

###Cases that have gone offline
Reforme.ma - citizen engagement to constitutional reform in Morroco.    
Each user could vote on each proposed article. Comments were submitted to national drafting committee. 40% of recommendations adopted into current constitution.

Nouasbook.ma tool with the aim of better feedback between politicians and citizens.
