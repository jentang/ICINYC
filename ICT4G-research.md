# ICT4G Research

## Design firm
[Mod Lab](https://mod-lab.com/)

## Platforms/software
[VotoMobile](https://www.votomobile.org/) - developed in Ghana and can use voice and SMS (allowing use of local languages), collects and can analyze data. Their API (computer code that sets the architecture of the program) is available so we can adapt it to our needs. I think it’s “open” even, so we can invite coders who are interested (there is a large community of civic coders) in our project to help us write the code for our needs.  
[Tracfm.org](http://tracfm.org/) - developed in Uganda to facilitate both polling, and then discussions on the radio.  
[Govright.org](http://govright.org/)- a platform that Tarik Nesh-Nash is part of launching, a generic platform built by Quanan lab to move towards a more open form of governance where citizens co-author laws.  
[Countable](https://www.countable.us/) website and app of bills coming to a vote, includes local section, allows for user vote and commenting, also can contact elected officials through the app.  
[allourideas.org](http://allourideas.org/) - super simple "wiki" survey building and polling platform.
