# ICT4G Research

## Design Firm
[Mod Lab](https://mod-lab.com/) - Design firm we'd like to work with 

## Platforms/software/apps
[Countable](https://www.countable.us/) - website and app of bills coming to a vote, includes local section, allows for user vote and commenting, also can contact elected officials through the app.  

[allourideas.org](http://allourideas.org/) - super simple "wiki" survey building and polling platform.  

[DemTech 2.0](https://nditech.org/projects) - a suite of 6 opensource tools for petitions, tracking Candidates' stances on issues, analyzing election data, collecting citizenn complaints, manage community contacts, and organize+visualize+share data. More about NDItech team that developed these tools is below.

[MetroQuest](http://metroquest.com/) - an online tool that offers us and users to do priority ranking, ratings (similar to our likert scales), map annotation, budget allocation (to see how participants would potentially spend a budget), open-ended answers, and straight-up surveys. They also support multiple languages.

[VotoMobile](https://www.votomobile.org/) - developed in Ghana and can use voice and SMS (allowing use of local languages), collects and can analyze data. Their API (computer code that sets the architecture of the program) is available so we can adapt it to our needs. I think it’s “open” even, so we can invite coders who are interested (there is a large community of civic coders) in our project to help us write the code for our needs.  

[Tracfm.org](http://tracfm.org/) - developed in Uganda to facilitate both polling, and then discussions on the radio. Also an SMS based platform. There is a more robust [push for using SMS tech](http://www.ictworks.org/2017/01/09/4-reasons-for-large-scale-sms-text-surveys-in-developing-countries/) in developing countries, but I don't know if we are more interested in a more complex and visual platform as web connectivity may be less of an issue for our population.

[Govright.org](http://govright.org/) - a platform that Tarik Nesh-Nash is part of launching, a generic platform built by Quanan lab to move towards a more open form of governance where citizens co-author laws.  

[Urban Metabolism Information System (UMIS) and Participtory Urban Metabolism Information System (PUMIS)](http://ecocitizenworldmap.org/understanding-your-city-by-understanding-its-flow-towards-participatory-urban-metabolism-information-systems/) is a way to measure, analyze, and visualize data flows that can also be mapped via GIS. UMIS and PUMIS has been used to measure and visualize water use, but this system _can_ be used to collect and visualize all kinds of data. Something to keep in mind.  
##Allies & Resources
**[Youth Participatory Politics Research Network](http://ypp.dmlcentral.net/)** runs [action](http://ypp.dmlcentral.net/action-projects) and [reserach](http://ypp.dmlcentral.net/research-projects) projects. They also collect some very useful [publications](http://ypp.dmlcentral.net/publications).   
Of _particular relevance_ to our tech design work right now is the [Digital Platforms Project](http://ypp.dmlcentral.net/projects/digital-platforms-project), a distillation of design principles aimed at platform designers.  
[The Youth Participatory Politics Survey Project](http://ypp.dmlcentral.net/projects/youth-participatory-politics-survey-project) is a nationally representative survey of how young people 15-25 experience and participate in public life.  
[The Good Participation Project](http://ypp.dmlcentral.net/projects/good-participation-project) is a study of young people’s civic and political participation in a digital age, and the interplay of conditions that promote "good participation."  
[The Activists and Participatory Politics project](http://ypp.dmlcentral.net/projects/activists-and-participatory-politics) seeks to provide support and highlight the effective practices of activist groups that promote participatory politics and youth civic and political engagement.  
[The Media, Activism, and Participatory Politics (MAPP) Project](http://ypp.dmlcentral.net/projects/media-activism-and-participatory-politics) - five case studies of youth-driven communities that scaffolded skills and networks of participatory culture into civic engagement and political participation for social change.  
The YPPRN is a project of...  

[Digital Media + Learning Research Hub](http://dmlhub.net/) - runs a [blog](http://dmlcentral.net/), and a [conference](http://dmlhub.net/conference/)  

[BetaNYC](https://beta.nyc/) - a group of civic hackers based in NYC. "NYC's civic design, civic technology, and open data community." They run...  

[School of Data](https://schoolofdata.nyc/open-call-for-school-of-data-session-proposals/) - now an annual civic tech and open data conference for the NYC community. It used to be a hackathon to celebrate Open Data Day, but has now morphed to encompass more.  

[Poplus](http://poplus.org) - a federated tech community of civic coders that helped to build the votaintelligente.cl and nousabook.ma (now offline) tools.  

[CUNY ServiceCorps](http://www1.cuny.edu/sites/servicecorps/community-partners/current/) - CUNY undergrads asigned to work with community organizations including City agencies. We could potentially apply to be a partner organization and have a student work with us.  

[NDItech](https://nditech.org) - a project of the [National Democratic Institute](https://www.demworks.org/) that created the DemTech2.0 tools, provides technical assistance, and publishes a weekly [blog](https://nditech.org/blog) that rounds up civic tech news. We may want to get in touch with NDItech.  

[GovLab](http://govlab.org) - an academic, training, advocacy organization run out of NYU that has been less active since 2016.  

[ict4dev.ma](http://ict4dev.ma) - focused on development, run by Tarik Nesh-Nash at Mundiapolis University.  
##Cases of ICT4G
[Participatory Budgeting NYC](http://ideas.pbnyc.org/page/about) using OpenPlans.  

[NYC Parks](http://blog.allourideas.org/post/49023446765/new-york-city-parks) using allourideas.  

[PlaNYC](http://blog.allourideas.org/post/6326304438/making-new-york-greener-and-greater) using allourideas.  

[EcoCitizen World Map Project](http://ecocitizenworldmap.org/), an example of a survey and mapping tool built on Ushahidi's platform.  
###Cases that have gone offline
Reforme.ma - citizen engagement to constitutional reform in Morroco.    
Each user could vote on each proposed article. Comments were submitted to national drafting committee. 40% of recommendations adopted into current constitution.  
Usage reflects engagement of Morrocan diaspora (25% outside of the country). Still very urban, bias with tech. 72% male use.  

Nouasbook.ma tool with the aim of better feedback between politicians and citizens.  
Platform to ask Questions of their MPs, and vote on citizen Q for MP. MPs then answer citizen questions.  
24MPs signed up to use it in 4 months. Citizen questions are moderated.  
##Literature
_I have collected various pieces of literature in a private [zotero group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/1014911)._
